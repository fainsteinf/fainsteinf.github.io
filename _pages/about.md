I am an Argentinian PhD candidate in Physics working at the [Dynamical Systems Lab](http://www.lsd.df.uba.ar/) under the advice of [Prof. Gabriel B. Mindlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_B._Mindlin). My research interests are broad, and encompass physics, biology and applied mathematics. With a strong physics background, I have specialized on nonlinear dynamics. I have 8+ years of experience on theoretical modelling, experimental instrumentation, and data acquisition and analysis. 

Large part of my work seeks to understand how physiological functions and animal behaviors emerge from the interaction between the nervous system, the body and the environment. By analyzing the nervous systemsâ€™ output and the physics of the body, I have helped develop physical models that connect neural instructions to movement and behavior (such as voiced sounds). The impact of these works is manifold. On the one hand, they inform fundamental questions such as how brain functions, how synergistic are brain-body interactions and to what extent living organism operate near physical limits. On the other hand, they advance neural-interface technologies and high-precision interpretable neural decoders.

I have also worked on the theory behind unsupervised data-driven discovery of governing equations. A key-step in this approach is the extraction of appropriate dynamical variables directly from data (such as videos or time series). I have contributed to show when some architectures (e. g., autoencoders) can recover variables that preserve the topology of the underlying phase space.

I am enthusiastic about interdisciplinary research, impactful science, and education.
