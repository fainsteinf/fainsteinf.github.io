I am an Argentinian PhD candidate in Physics at the [Dynamical Systems Lab](http://www.lsd.df.uba.ar/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriel B. Mindlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_B._Mindlin). My research interests are broad, and encompass physics, biology and applied mathematics. With a strong physics background, I have specialized on nonlinear dynamics. I have 8+ years of experience on theoretical modelling, experimental instrumentation, and data acquisition and analysis. 

A large part of my work seeks to understand how physiological functions and animal behaviors emerge from interactions between the nervous system, the body, and the environment. By analyzing neural output alongside the physics of the body, I have helped develop physical models that link neural instructions to movement and behavior (e.g., vocal sounds). These studies both address fundamental questions—how the brain functions, how synergistic brain–body interactions are, and whether living organisms operate near physical limits—and advance neural-interface technologies through high-precision, interpretable neural decoders.

I have also worked on the theory of unsupervised, data-driven discovery of governing equations. A key step in this approach is extracting appropriate dynamical variables directly from data (such as videos or time series). I have helped show when certain architectures (e.g., autoencoders) can recover variables that preserve the topology of the underlying phase space.

I am enthusiastic about interdisciplinary research, impactful science, and education.
