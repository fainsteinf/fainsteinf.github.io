Song production in oscine birds is a complex learned behavior that arises from the interaction between the nervous system and peripheral devices. How the acoustical properties of the sound emerge from the delicate and fast control of several muscles in the syrinx (birds' vocal organ) and the respiratory system is not completely understood. 

During my PhD we recorded electromyographic activity of the syringealis ventralis (vS) muscle and air sac pressure in canaries (Serinus canaria) during singing. Using dynamical models with biologically interpretable parameters, developed by Prof. Gabriel B. Mindlin and his collaborators, we can translate these motor signals into sound.

    From physiological variables and neural signals to sound. We measured air sac pressure and syringealis ventralis (vS) muscle EMG. An interpretable dynamical model condesates the physics of sound production, and allows to translate these signals into sound.

Our results reveal that nonlinearities in the vocal apparatus enable the emergence of complex sounds from relatively simple motor instructions measured. They inform on the detailed motor control of a learned complex behavior, and additionally, this work advances efforts to achieve interpretable transformations from neural signals to vocal output.
