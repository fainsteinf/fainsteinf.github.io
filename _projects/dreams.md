Sleep is an essential feature of animal life and a period in which brains do not stop. During sleep, neural networks display replay activity: brain structures reactivate with patterns similar to those observed during waking behavior. While there is ample evidence that this activity plays an important role in memory consolidation, its specific role in establishing and consolidating motor mechanisms is not clear. A fundamental step to its understanding will come with a long-history desire: an interpretable replay activity decoder. 

During my PhD, under the advice of Prof. Gabriel B. Mindlin and working with his collaborator Prof. Franz Goller, we discovered that birds exhibit spontaneous, complete song-like peripheral reactivation during night sleep {% cite fainstein2025song %}. That is: not only brain structures reactivate, but neural activity can also be measured in muscles used to produce song. The amplitude of movements is small, so sounds are not produced. Our findings include the presence of song-like activity in respiratory muscles, leading to song-like air sac pressure patterns of low amplitude, and the simultaneous reactivation of syringeal muscles (muscles in birdsâ€™ vocal organ).

This result opens the path for an interpretable decoding of replay activity of a learnt, complex behavior. The reason is that even though the neural code is not known, the gap between EMG activity and behavior is much closer.
